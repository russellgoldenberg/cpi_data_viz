Do you have a favorite beach, pond, or water body on the Cape? Drop a pin on the map, and then upload an image or describe what makes it so special."422,Why Cape Cod?,1,"The Cape brings all kinds of people together. Whether you were born and raised here, or just love spending time here, your connection to the Cape is all your own. Do you remember why you or your family first came to the Cape? What brought you here?"423,If We Do Nothing...,1,"We know that the future quality of the Cape's water is in jeopardy due to an overabundance of nitrogen in our ecosystem. The resources on the left explore this problem. What will happen if we do nothing? Take a moment to look at the resources, and then consider your answers to the previous two challenges. How would this future scenario change your favorite places, or your reasons for coming here?"425,Fun on the Cape,1,"Cape Cod is a wonderful place to be outdoors. What is your favorite outdoor activity? Share a photo, upload a video, or just explain what makes this activity so rewarding to you."426,Algae Spotters!,1,"Seeing large accumulations of algae in a body of water is often a sign of excess nitrogen. These ""algae blooms"" can have a number of harmful consequences to our environment. Have you seen algae in the water or at any of your favorite beaches or ponds? If so, let us know where, or upload a photo."427,Where Your Wastewater Goes,1,"Cape Cod has 105 watersheds. Water in these watersheds drains either directly to the ocean, or to one of our coastal bays (called an embayment). Our embayments tend to have higher nitrogen concentrations than the open ocean. This makes them prime habitat for destructive algae blooms. Using the resources, find where you live or stay on the Cape, and tell us whether your house is located in a watershed that contributes to a coastal bay (embayment), or a watershed that contributes directly to the open ocean."429,Meet Lin,1,"Lin has some plans for her future, and imagines herself as a life-long Cape resident. If nothing is done about the nitrogen problem, how will her future be affected? How might her plans need to change? What actions, if any, could she or her parents take to help preserve the future life she's working toward?"430,Meet Jason,1,"Imagine you're a friend of Jason's, and he brings up the environmental problems he's noticed in conversation. What argument(s) would you make to convince him to become more civically active about this issue? Why should he be? How could his business be affected if nothing is done?"431,Meet Betsy,1,"If you were Betsy, what steps might you take to protect your property and help improve the water quality on Cape Cod? What would be your first priority? What long-term steps might you take?"433,Septic Woes,1,"Most of the excess nitrogen in Cape Cod's water bodies comes from water draining from septic systems. On average, a household with a traditional septic system contributes 10 lbs of Nitrogen to its watershed each year. Over 20 years, installing and maintaining your septic systems can cost $1,150 annually and approximately $13,000 if it needs to be replaced. To avoid total septic system failure and to keep it working properly, a septic system should be properly maintained. When was the last time you, or your family, had your septic tank pumped, or replaced?"434,What Will You Do?,1,"The nitrogen problem on the Cape is large and complex. Everyone contributes nitrogen, and no single solution to manage it would work and be affordable. However, individuals can have a real, direct impact on reducing nitrogen. Which (if any) of the following actions would you be willing to take? Do you know any other ways you can help? Take a look at the attached resources for more information on these options."435,Is It Affordable?,1,"The federal government estimates that a household spends approximately 1% of their income on water and wastewater treatment each year. Based on the median Cape Cod income, that equals roughly $582/year. Would you, or your family, be able to pay this amount annually for water and wastewater treatment on Cape Cod?"437,In A Word,2,"The Cape is a collection of unique towns and neighborhoods, no two exactly alike. What one word or phrase do you think best describes your Cape Cod community?"438,Wetter Is Better,2,"Earlier, we talked about how important water is to Cape Cod. In your opinion, how do beaches, ponds, and water bodies shape the identity of your Cape Cod community? If you can, share a photo or video of a place in your community that fits your description."439,Cape Trekking,2,"Other than the town that you live or stay in, which Cape Cod communities have you visited? Use your comment to tell us what is your favorite place to visit on the Cape, outside of your own community."441,Priciest Properties,2,"Communities use property taxes to pay for services, such as schools, libraries, and beaches for residents and visitors. Property taxes are a percentage of the value of property in the community, based on the total funds needed to cover all the service the town provides. Place a pin on the map where you think the highest-value property on Cape Cod is. Use your comment to explain your reasoning. "442,Tax Hikes,2,"Imagine that the values of coastal properties have decreased because of the impacts of excess nitrogen. To cover the decrease in revenue from these coastal properties, the town must raise the tax rate and apply the higher rate to all property owners in the community. What effect do you think this would have on your household finances?"443,Meet Frank,2,"What advice would you give Frank to help him decide how to vote about the taxes he'll have to pay? Should he vote ""yes,"" which may lead to small short-term cuts in the school budget but long-term improvement in the environment? Or ""no,"" which may lead to adequate school funding now but continued degradation of the environment and problems for the Cape's economy? Which factors should he weigh?"445,Meet Mia,2,Can you think of any ways Mia could encourage her parents to participate in the process of finding a solution to the Cape's wastewater problem? What should she do?446,How Should Cape Cod Grow?,2,"It is estimated that an additional 27,000 new homes can be built on Cape Cod. Even if we reduce nitrogen from existing development, any additional growth would add more nitrogen to the water system if the new homes use septic systems. Much of the potential residential growth could be in areas far away from existing development, making it very expensive to provide sewer. A number of solutions are being discussed to help prevent increased nitrogen from future development. Of these options, which would you support? Check any that apply,"447,Greener Solutions,2,"We can use the natural environment to reduce existing and future nitrogen levels in several ways. For example, we could help tides move water more easily in and out of our salt marshes and embayments, construct new wetland areas, or buy land for open space. All increase the opportunity for the environment to process nitrogen naturally. These strategies have the added benefit of providing habitat and recreational opportunities, but they also cost money. Would you support a wastewater plan that prioritized these ""greener"" solutions to reduce the amount of nitrogen in the water naturally, potentially reducing the cost of traditional wastewater treatment (like sewer)? Why, or why not?"449,One-of-a-Kind Cape,3,Cape Cod is a coastal peninsula connected by its water. We have a unique environment unlike other parts of Massachusetts and the rest of the country. Tell us some things that you think are unique to Cape Cod?450,Your Pond,3,"The Cape has 994 freshwater ponds. Do you know the name of your nearest pond? How do you use it? Share your experiences here, upload a picture, or share a video."451,Go With the Flow,3,"Cape Cod is made up primarily of sand and gravel left behind by glaciers. These porous soils contain significant groundwater that is suitable for drinking but harmed when untreated wastewater from septic tanks leak into it. The good news is that in many places on the Cape, water travels through the ground within 10 years (very fast!). This means that reducing nitrogen today could bring improvements within one generation. Does knowing this timetable make you more likely to support local and regional wastewater planning efforts?"453,Prior Knowledge,3,"Apart from this game, have you heard elsewhere about the issues of too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the Cape's waters? Use your comment to tell us where you first learned about this issue, or share any thoughts you have about spreading the word."454,Freshwater Refresh,3,"Generally, freshwater ponds located within the Cape Cod National Seashore experience less eutrophication (excess nutrients and algae growth) than other freshwater ponds on the Cape, particularly in Truro and Wellfleet. This is because the amount of development is limited within the National Seashore. Would you support limits to some development near water bodies elsewhere on the Cape? "455,How Do You Sewer?,3,"One very effective approach to wastewater and nitrogen management is providing traditional sewers. Sewering is best suited for areas where development is closer together, since collecting wastewater that way is less costly. When homes and businesses are spread far apart, collection costs for centralized treatment increase dramatically. Do you think your neighborhood would be appropriate for sewering? Why or why not?"457,Tasty Cape,3,"Cape Cod is known for its local products, including cranberries, shellfish, and even beer. What is your favorite product native to the Cape? Does it depend upon water quality in some way?"458,Jason - Thinking Bigger,3,"As he learns about the issues, Jason has begun worrying more about the effects of water quality on his business. Lately, he has begun attending community meetings, arguing for fast corrective action by his town. Others are arguing that a coordinated approach between towns is needed to lower costs. How would a coordinated effort between towns benefit him?"459,See You There?,3,"In developing a regional plan to restore the Cape's water quality, the Cape Cod Commission is facilitating local discussions about affordable and appropriate solutions for watersheds. Public meetings will build on local planning efforts and participants will discuss solutions that work across town boundaries. Would you, or members of your family, participate in these kind of meetings, or would you prefer another way?"461,Paying the Bill,3,Preliminary estimates of the cost of a wastewater solution on Cape Cod range from $4.2 and $6.2 billion. Many options are available to pay for these solutions. Who should pay for the Cape's wastewater solution? Check all those who you think should contribute.462,Meet Arturo,3,Why should Arturo care about the future of the water supply? Can you think how he may be affected?463,Imagining the Future...,3,"By now, you know more than most about the water quality problems facing the Cape as well as the possible solutions. The Cape Cod Commission is at the start of a lengthy process to develop a wastewater management plan to address water quality here. The plan aims to restore degraded water bodies while protecting taxpayers from unnecessary costs. Think about how you would like the Cape waters to look 50 years from now. How should we involve you and your neighbors in ensuring that this future happens? "490,Let's Celebrate,2,"Tell us about any festivals that take place in your community. Are they connected in some way to Cape Cod's water, or feature produce or products that comes from the water?"491,Changes,2,"Tracking and understanding changes in the environment is extremely important. Have you noticed any changes to the beaches, ponds or water bodies in your community? If so, describe the changes. Upload a picture, share a video, or describe where and how your community is changing."492,All Ears,2,"Imagine that you are at a community meeting, and have been asked to explain to local officials in your town why you think it's important to protect Cape Cod's environment for future generations. What would you say?"
