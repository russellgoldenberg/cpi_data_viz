How well do you comprehend the issue right now? Explain your understanding of the water management problem on the Cape as simply as possible in 50 words or less, or in a 6-second video (upload to YouTube), or in a drawing (upload a .jpg file)."670,Too Much of a Good Thing,1,"We all use water from the Cape's aquifer in our daily lives, and almost all the water we use re-enters the environment and continues through the water cycle. Think about your activity, or your family's activity, over the past three days. How did you use water? Check all that apply."672,Watersheds,1,"Think of a watershed as a defined area where all the water ""shed"" from the land after a rainstorm or snow melt, as well as the water flowing underground, ends up in the same water body. On Cape Cod, watersheds flow either into the ocean directly, or into one of the Cape's many bays or estuaries. Water does not flow according to town boundaries, so most of us share a watershed with people from several different communities. Use the map to identify the watershed your home is located in, and tell us how many towns share this same watershed."676,Nitrogen: Within Our Control,1,"Nitrogen is an abundant element and essential for all living things.It makes up almost 80% of the air we breathe but as a gas it is generally inaccessible as a nutrient. The forms of nitrogen that can be problematic for the environment occur both naturally and from human activity. All natural systems have an ability to accommodate nutrients such as nitrogen. In fact, healthy systems require a certain level of nutrients to sustain themselves. This ability is not unlimited, however, and there comes a tipping point when things go out of balance. To solve the Cape's nutrient problem, we have to look to what we can control. Which of the following nitrogen contributors do you think Cape Codders are likely to be able to control the most?"677,How does your garden grow?,1,Take a look at the photos of different types of yards in the resources. Which of these looks most like your yard? Share a photo of your yard and estimate how much fertilizer you think is applied to your yard per year?679,Of Ethics and Aesthetics,1,"Jason has started to think about how much fertilizer he uses at his home and on the landscaping around the Cafe. He is trying to weigh the importance of presenting an attractive property for the neighborhood as well as his customers, while being mindful of the environmental consequences of using fertilizers. How can he make changes that balance these interests? Will his actions have a significant effect on the nitrogen problem?"682,"Cleaning Up Our ""Act""",1,"Our country has an agency charged with the protection of our environment, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. In 1972, Congress enacted a powerful law called the Clean Water Act and charged the EPA with enforcing it. The Act sets limits on pollution in our waterways and watersheds and is the basis for the water quality plan now being updated by the Cape Cod Commission. Learn more about this law in the resource. The Clean Water Act addresses all of the following factors. Which of these do you think are the most important for Cape Cod? (Select up to three)"684,Pin Down Protection,1,"President John F Kennedy designated the seashore lands in the Outer Cape to form a National Park in 1961. This has protected the seashore in perpetuity from most development, in turn removing the potential impacts of nutrients on many Outer Cape waters. In addition, much undeveloped land has been protected elsewhere on Cape Cod. The benefits of this open space are many: filtering of water and air; the avoidance of nitrogen associated with development; habitat for plants and animals; flood protection; recreational lands for residents and visitors. Place a pin in a map in an open space area near where you live that you have enjoyed, and tell us what benefits it provides, and whether it is permanently protected."685,Protecting Our Ponds,1,"There are 994 freshwater ponds on Cape Cod, many of which were left behind by the glacier that formed the peninsula and are filled with groundwater. These ponds provide a way for the overall quality of water in our watersheds to be measured. A team of volunteers monitors a significant number of these ponds, regularly taking samples of the water. Look at the graph and graphic in the resources that shows data for total phosphorus in a single pond on Cape Cod. What do you notice, if anything, about the data? What do you think this means for the health of the pond? Using the qualitative descriptions provided, interperate the data and share your findings."690,A...Muse,1,Write a short poem such as a limerick or haiku that describes the Cape's wastewater problem.692,Following Footprints,1,Go to the website in the resources and poke around a little. Calculate your nitrogen footprint and share it with us. Tell us how you think you can change the amount nitrogen you contribute to the Cape's environment?698,Last one in the water...,1,"Explore the Time of Travel Map. The time it takes for a drop of water to travel from our homes to the ocean will affect how quickly we can expect to see improvements in water quality. With this in mind, consider a time table for a solution. When do you expect we'd see evidence of results? How long is too long to wait?"704,Once Upon a Cape,2,"Cape Cod is surrounded by water, and many of us have a strong connection to this marine environment. Whether you fish, swim, boat, or just enjoy looking at the water, it is hard to imagine life on Cape Cod without a clean and thriving ocean habitiat. At the same time, we are all partly responsible for increased levels of nutrients arriving at the ocean from our watersheds. Algae blooms can deprive other plants and animals in the water of light and oxygen, resulting in them moving away if they can, or dying. In no more than three sentences, write a story about how excess nutrients effect plants, shellfish, and animals in the marine environment on the Cape. Your story must contain these words: oyster, fish, eelgrass, bag of fertilizer, backhoe."706,What You'd Miss,2,"When a bay or pond ""eutrophies"" (see resource), fish can die off due to lack of oxygen. Which of these organisms threatened by eutrophication would you miss the most? Select one, and then use your comment to tell us how you would be affected if it went away. "708,Source and Sink,2,"Scientists often describe the dynamics of ecology using the terms ""sources"" (the source of the nutrient or energy) and ""sinks"" (where the energy or nutrient goes). On the Cape, our ""sinks"" include ponds, bays, estuaries, and marshes. As you understand it, what are the ""sources"" that affect the Cape's nitrogen levels? "711,Any Way You Slice It,2,"For this challenge, imagine the economy is like a pizza „ the bigger the pizza, the more there is to ""eat,"" and the stronger our economy. The Cape's economy is shaped by our geography, history, and people. After reviewing the resources provided, imagine that you are making a pizza to represent the Cape's economy. Choose three ""toppings"" that are representative of what you think are the three most important ""slices"" of the economy for the Cape and explain your choices."713,Building on Our Assets,2,"Cape Cod's natural environment is a huge asset for our economy, especially our tourism industry. Tourism contributes roughly $2.3 billion to our economy annually and employs one in three people employed on Cape Cod. To keep our economy strong, we need to maintain a healthy environment and maintain our ""competitive advantage."" Tells us ways you think you can help contribute to the Cape's economic health."715,Paying For the Future,2,"Cape leaders recognize that to keep local costs down, we will need outside financial help to address our wastewater issues. With estimates in the billions of dollars over two generations, we can do our part by minimizing the cost of projects through use of the lowest cost technologies, economies of scale, and collaboration. Choose your top three ways you think may help to pay for this, or suggest a creative way of your own."719,Seasonal Boom,2,"If youÍve experienced the CapeÍs summer traffic, it should be no surprise that seasonal visitors swell our population two to three times during these three months. Much like the need to build roads to accommodate these peak times, we need to plan our water infrastructure, both for drinking and disposal, to meet summerÍs increased demand. If there was a way to charge summer visitors to help pay for these systems, would that be fair? Explain."720,All Ages,2,"The average age of the CapeÍs residents is increasing. Almost a quarter of our population is over 65, compared to only 13.5% for Massachusetts. Cape Cod is also a great place to retire, so that proportion of the CapeÍs community is likely to get bigger. This demographic makes finding a solution that this segment of our society can support more challenging as many are on fixed incomes and may not be able to pay more in taxes. What do you think is the appropriate thing to do for this segment of our population?"721,Meet Jim,2,"When Jim was elected to the board of selectmen, he promised not to raise taxes. Lately there's been a lot of discussion about wastewater needs in his town and regionally, most of which require significant investments that will likely increase local taxes. The town meeting is due to vote on funding the town's wastewater plan, and Jim has been convinced that funding the wasteater plan is the right thing to do. How does he convince town meeting voters that this is the right course of action?"724,Our Hero,2,"Imagine the Cape had a super hero with powers to tackle any wastewater problem. What issue would your super-hero tackle first, and what powers would they have to combat the issue?"725,Time Machine,2,"The nutrient problem on Cape Cod is a result of a long history of decisions and human activities impacting our natural systems. If you could turn back the clock or travel back in time, what advice would you give to the policy makers in the past to avert a future wastewater crisis?"726,Tweet for Change,2,"Cape Cod has one aquifer, 15 towns, 17 water districts, 54 embayments and 165 watersheds. Part of the challenge of finding solutions is that the resources and sources of the problem overlap. Who should be responsible for addressing this problem? Imagine you are sending a tweet (no more than 140 characters) to an elected official, tell them who is most appropriate to coordinate a solution."730,A Natural Partnership,3,"The natural environment provides many benefits, or ñservicesî, that we rely on, such as converting Carbon Dioxide to Oxygen. Some of these services also reduce nitrogen levels in groundwater and surface-water bodies. We can enhance the natural environmentÍs ability to process nitrogen naturally in several ways, including: allowing ways for more tidewater to flow through our salt marshes and embayments, constructing new wetland areas, planting nitrogen-loving trees, or buying land for open space. These strategies have the added benefit of providing habitat and recreational opportunities, but they also cost money. What best fits your view of utilizing natural systems to help remove nitrogen from the water? Explain your thinking."734,Ur in ChaNge,3,"The term ""eco-toilets"" is used to describe toilets that capture urine at its source before it is diluted in the groundwater. They require additional maintenance and plumbing over what is in your home today. If these kinds of toilets were available for free, what would it take for you to install one? "736,Pure and Polished,3,"Did you know you can polish water? Polishing means that impurites in water are removed through various kinds of natural chemical processes in wetlands, tree roots, or natural material (e.g. plant roots, wood chips). These processes happen naturally in wetlands and can be enhanced by specially designed natural systems. From what you know of this ""polishing"" process, how many objects in your home can you think of that llustrate a similar process? List as many as you can think of here, and explain your thinking."740,What a Rush!,3,Look at the sequence of maps showing changes in how the land on Cape Cod has been used between 1951 and 1999. During this time the population grew significantly (see resources) due to the dramatic increase in residential land use in that time. Why the big rush? What do you think are the top three reasons why people come to the Cape to live?742,Requiring Action,3,"The vast majority of residential development on Cape Cod uses on-site Title V septic systems to treat wastewater (see resources). Septic systems are very effective at removing pathogens, but not effective in removing Nitrogen. These systems are replaced when they fail, but usually with no requirement to remove nitrogen. Based on what you've learned from earlier this game (or any other source) should a replacement system be required to remove nitrogen? Explain why in your comment."745,Controlling Growth,3,"You learned in the previous mission that as much as 18% more residential units can be built on Cape Cod under today's land use regulations (zoning). Not only do we have to address nitrogen from existing development, but in most cases, we have to plan for the Nitrogen possible from future development. Depending on where this growth occurs, the cost of any wastewater infrastructure solutions will likely increase to accomodate the added wastewater flow created. One option is to consider changing the amount or pattern of new development so the problem doesn't grow worse, or the solution more expensive. Would you support any of these changes to land use in the region? Click all those you would support, or offer one of your own."749,Where Do You Watershed?,3,"As you have learned through earlier challenges, you share a watershed with many other people, businesses, and in some cases with other towns. Using the resource, tell us what watershed you live in. If you don't live on the Cape, tell us the watershed you work in, or last visited."750,How Many Groups?,3,"Getting broad community support for any solution is essential to the successful implementation of a plan, particularly when funding must be approved through a vote at our town meetings. Watershed groups are being established that have the goal of representing the interests of the residents of a watershed, to advocate for the health of the watershed, and to advise on the preparation of solutions. Larger groupings include more people in these discussions, but make the process of finding a solution more complex. Smaller groupings allow issues to be looked at in greater detail, but involve less people. What do you think is the most approriate scale for these groups to work at? "752,Paying Your Share,3,All solutions to our problem will involve paying something. Nothing is free. Tell us ways that would make you comfortable paying your share of the solution.755,Making the Grade,3,"Through a school science class, Mia has learned about the nutrient problem on Cape Cod, and that her family's house is located in a watershed with a severe excess amount of nitrogen. The bay she likes to go to in the summer has become a little scummy and smells bad as algae mats decay. She has decided to do a science fair project to raise awareness of this issue. She has figured out how much her family (four people) contributes to the nitrogen problem, and thought about some things that people can do to reduce their nitrogen impact. You are going to help her with her project. Give Mia one fact, drawing, photo, or recommendation that she can include in her project to help her get an A+. "756,Balancing Act,3,"The Cape is a fragile peninsula, popular as a place to live, retire, and visit. In addition to environmental issues, we also have trouble keeping young people on the Cape, providing well paid year round jobs, and more development places added pressure on the natural environment, including our water supply. If you were in charge, what could you do to balance these issues?"757,Make a Contribution,3,"You have been asked to contribute to a book about the Cape Cod nutrient problem. Tell us a joke you would tell your grandmother (G-rated only) that relates to the wastewater problem on Cape Cod, or draw a picture, or take a photo, or something else that helps illustrate the problem."
